# Automotive Door Module SWC

This repo can be donwloaded and opened into your Davinci Developer workspace. 

## Overview

As part of our Automotive Software Development module we were asked to design and specify a set of AUTOSTAR application components to implement a driver door module. The drive door modules control all four mirrors in a car and controls both the left and right side mirrors. This application will be created in Vectors Davinci Developer where we can auto generate its C code which we can alter or add methods to.

The door module has the following control operations:
- Four independent buttons (1-4) which controls four door mirrors.
- A joypad which controls the selected side mirror.
- A single button when pressed locks all window except the drivers mirror.
